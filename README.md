# aws-tools

Fed of having to open the AWS Consele to find out basic info about an Instance or ALB? AWS-Tools is a simplified set of tools that allow you to quickly grab information about your current AWS resources and is aimed to be quick to use and consistent in interface design unlike the Boto 3 based AWS CLI.

The tooling is written in Go in order to create tooling that works in the most places possible.
